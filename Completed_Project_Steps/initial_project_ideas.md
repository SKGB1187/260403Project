# Project Ideas

In this file (but not restricted to), you can use to get used to working on this repository and jot down project ideas to easily be shared with your mentors and to keep the history of!

# Background Information
## Identifying Initial Project Ideas

Please come up with three project ideas for sites you’d like to build. These should be sites that you’re interested in working on but should not be too complex. Please keep in mind that you are going to spend 45-65 hours working on this capstone project. Be sure to reach out to your mentor if you’re ever feeling stuck as you brainstorm.
__Note__: The goal of this project isn’t to create something that’s never been done before, We want you to work on a challenging project that will incorporate all of the back-end skills you’ve been developing and some of your front-end skills from the last section. You can create a website similar to one that already exists, or use a popular API.

## Submitting Your Ideas
-	In the starter code, refer to the file initial_project_ideas.md
-	Write a short blurb explaining each of your ideas. – Be sure to highlight the idea that you think you’d most like to work on. – The blurb should, at a high level, describe the problem and the data you’ll be using to solve it. At this point, there’s no need to talk about specific tools and technologies.
-	You can post your ideas, with a title, to your Slack community and solicit feedback from other students.
-	Submit your ideas to your mentor for review. Work with them to narrow in on the idea that you will move forward with. Create a new branch, edit this file and create a pull request for your mentor to review these ideas.
- __Pause__: you will need a mentor’s approval before moving on to the next step.

# Project Ideas to be Reviewed
The following are my three initial project ideas for Capstone Project One:
- __Idea 1__: Integration with the Spotify API in order to generate tailored randomizations. For anyone who commonly utilizes Spotify, they may have noticed that the same 20-30 songs are randomized for the entire day’s playlist. This randomization leads to the same song set being played over and over when listening to Spotify during work hours or when driving long distances. The idea of this application would be for listeners to be able to select specific songs that they wish to have randomized and generate a playlist for the day that can be returned to Spotify.
- __Idea 2__: Use the EONET API to return to people where other people on the planet are experiencing similar natural events. The goal would be to help people who are feeling isolated and stress by showing them other regions of the world that are experiencing similar conditions to what they are experiencing and to include the satellite imagery for those events for the individual to compare.
- __Idea 3__: Use the Programming Quote API and the APOD API to generate programmer memes that have celestial backgrounds to them. It is easy to get bogged down in the code and deadlines to forget about the endless wonder of the universe. This would be a nice reminder of how amazing programming and life really is.
